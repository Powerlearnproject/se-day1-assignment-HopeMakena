Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the process of designing, developing, testing and maintaining software application.
The importance:
Efficienty- significantly increasing productivityand streamlining business process across indrustries.
Security-implement protection practice and encryption to secure users information.
Reliability- ensure software performs as expectedwithout bias.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Mastering market
Mastering productivity
Mastering communication

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

Planing- planning helps to define problem and any existing systems,and also help to secure funding and resorces need to make their plan to happen.
Analyisis- gather all details required for a new system,as well as determining the first ideas for prototype.
Design- developers outline the details for ther overall application, such as user interfaces, system interface, network and nertwork requirements and databases.
Development- developers will follow any codingguidelines as defined by the organization and utilize different tools such as debuggers,compliers and interpreters.
Testing- testing must be done to make sure that there is no any bugs and that the end-user experience will not negatively be affected at any point. During testing developers wiil go over their software with a fine-tooth comb, noting any bugs or defects that need to be tracked fixed and later retested.
Implementation and integration- after testing all design for the software will come together, the important system will be intergrated into its environment and eventually installed.
Maintenance- developers are responsible for implementing any changes that the software might need after deployment. This can include handling residual bugs that were not able to be patched before launch or resolving new issues that crop up due to user reports.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall- each phase of the project is gated.
-Criteria for the project are generated in the first stage.
-The requirements set forth in the beginning ideally do not change during the course of the development project.

Agile- breaks work into interative steps.
-complete one sprint before moving onto the next one.
-requirements can change at any time in the project based on changing business needs.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software developer- is responsible for designing, coding, testing, and deploying.
-Understanding user needs and traslating them into functional software specifications.
-Preparing and deploying the software application to production environment.

Quality Assurance Engineer- responsible for ensuring that products meets established quality standarts by testing them thoroughly.
-Identifying defects.
-Ultimately aiming to prevent quality problems and deliver a high quality product to customers.

Project Manager-assisting with tasks to members based on their skills.
-Facilitating clear communication between the development team, clients, stakeholders and other departments.
-Tracking project expenses and ensuring the project stays within budget constraints.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
An Intergrated Development Environment(IDE)-is a software application designed to assist developers in writting, compilling and debugging their code efficiently. eg.Visual Studio Code (VSCode)
-Efficiency and produtivity are paramount in software development.
-Enaable multiple developers to work in the same codebase. 
-Offers tools for coding, testing and debugging within a unified interface.

Version Control Systems-are essential for tracking changes in code, enabling collaboration and ensuring the intergrity of the codebase.eg Git
-Tracks changes to the database, providing a history of modification and enabling developers to revert to previous version.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Debugging- finding and fixxing errors in large codebase.
Security- software engineers must protect against security threats from hackers.
Conflicts-conflicts between software engineers and testers can arise due to different mindsets and product quality.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing- the first level of functional testing.
-ensures that individual parts of an appllication work correctly.

System testing- focus on testing the intire system behaviour and reliability.
 Itergration testing- test on how different parts of a system work along.
 -verify that multiple components collaborate corrent.
 Acceptance testing determine the acceptability of a product based on the agreement between the parties.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt egeneering is the process of structuring an instruction in order to produce generative AI systems to create specefic , high-quality outputs.
Importance: 
Improved user experience- user avoid trial and error and still receive coherent, accurate and relevant responses from AI tools.
Increased flexibility- prompt engineer can create prompts with domain-neutral intructions highlighting  logical links and broad patterns.
Greater develope control- they prevent your users from misusing the AI.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
